/**
 * The number of nodes in our perfect binary tree is always odd.
 * We know this because the first level always has 1 node, and the other levels always have an even number of nodes.
 * Adding a bunch of even numbers always gives us an even number, and adding 1 to that result always gives us an odd number.
 *
 * Taking half of an odd number gives us a fraction.
 * So if the last level had exactly half of our nn nodes, it would have to have a "half-node." But that's not a thing.
 *
 * Instead, it has the "rounded up" version of half of our odd nn nodes.
 * In other words, it has the exact half of the one-greater-and-thus-even number of nodes n+1. Hence {n+1}/{2}
 *
 * So our height (h) is roughly "the number of times we have to double 1 to get to {n+1}/{2}
 *  We can phrase this as a logarithm:
 *
 * h  â‰ˆ log ({n+1}/{2})
 *
 * In big O notation the base is considered a constant. So folks usually don't include it.
 * People usually say O(log n), not O( log base{2} n )
